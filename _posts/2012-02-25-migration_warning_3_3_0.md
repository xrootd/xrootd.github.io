Warning for sites using PROOF upgrading to 3.3.0
------------------------------------------------

We have encountered a binary incompatibility issue in one of the private
xrootd classes used by PROOF. The incompatibility will be resolved in
xrootd 3.3.1, so the sites using PROOF and not willing to recompile the
software stack are advised to postpone the update and wait for 3.3.1.
