Release candidate announcement - 4.0.0-rc1
------------------------------------------

The XRootD 4.0.0 release candidate 1 has been tagged. Please follow the links
below for the source and the RPMs. Please note that the RPMs have been pushed
to the testing yum repositories, however, the packages have been renamed to
xrootd4, so they need to be explicitly installed.
